Background
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges as shown in Figure 1. The nodes are
sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs. They are data structures used to model
pairwise relations between objects. The vertices are used to model the objects and edges connecting two
vertices that are used to model the pairwise relation between those objects. They are used to solve many
real-life problems. Graphs are used to represent networks. The networks may include paths in a city or
telephone network or circuit network.
4.3.1 List All
List all command is used for listing all the possible flight plan(s) from departure point to the arrival point.
4.3.2 List Proper
List proper command is used for listing all the proper flight plan(s) from departure point to the arrival
point which means a flight plan should be removed from the resulting flight plan set if there is another
flight plan which is both quicker (that arrives at the final destination earlier) and cheaper.
4.3.3 List Cheapest
List cheapest command is used for listing the cheapest possible flight plan(s) from departure point to the
arrival point. Keep in mind that there may be more than one possible cheapest flight plans.
4.3.4 List Quickest
List quickest command is used for listing the quickest possible flight plan(s) from departure point to the
arrival point. Keep in mind that there may be more than one possible quickest flight plans.
4.3.5 List Cheaper
List cheaper command is used for listing all the proper flight plans from departure point to the arrival
point that are cheaper than given parameter
4.3.6 List Quicker
List quicker command is used for listing all the proper flight plans from departure point to the arrival
point that arrive to the destination earlier than given parameter
4.3.7 List Excluding
List excluding command is used for listing all the proper flight plans from departure point to the arrival
point that do not involve a flight from given airlines company.
4.3.8 List Only From
List excluding command is used for listing all the proper flight plans from departure point to the arrival
point that consists of flights only from the given airlines company.
4.3.9 Diameter of Graph
The diameter of graph is the maximum distance between the pair of vertices. It can also be defined as the
longest shortest path.
4.3.10 PageRank of Nodes
PageRank (PR) is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages in their search engine results.
PageRank is a way of measuring the importance of website pages. The basic idea of PageRank is that the
importance of a web page depends on the pages that link to it. For instance, we create a web page i that
includes a hyperlink to web page j. If there are a lot pages also link to j, we then consider j is important on
the web.
